## Hey there ðŸ‘‹

<!--
**Moonbeam69/Moonbeam69** is a âœ¨ _special_ âœ¨ repository because its `README.md` (this file) appears on your GitHub profile. -->

I've built a number of show case projects to develop my understanding of software engineering approaches and demonstrate some best practice. I've used both Gemini or ChatGPT as co-pilot and have picked up some super interesting experiences with these along the way.

## eAssert

 - custom assertions library for Java (not based on AssertJ or Truth)
 - supports fluency

## CICD demo:

- GitHub Actions:

  - actions/checkout
  - actions/cache
  - actions/setup-java
  - actions/upload-artifact

- Multiple self-hosted runners
  - Windows 10
  - Linux/GNOME (OpenSuse 15.5)
  - Linux CLI-only (OpenSuse 15.5)

- Junit 5 test cases
  
- Playwright test cases
  - Chrome
  - FF
  - Webkit (Safari)

- Test tools
  - Rest-Assured / RestSharp
  - Wiremock
  - Allure (TBD) & customer test reporting classes
  - Browserstack integration
 
- Docker image creation
 - JAR deployment and execution

## Assertions Review:

- Junit5 native assertions
- Junit5 with Hamcrest matchers
