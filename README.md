## Nice to finally meet you! ðŸ‘‹

<!--
**Moonbeam69/Moonbeam69** is a âœ¨ _special_ âœ¨ repository because its `README.md` (this file) appears on your GitHub profile. -->

I've managed test automation-first approaches and CICD pipelines on a few of my last projects. The practical & commercial realities (read limitations) of these programmes has compelled me to setup my own project and experiment will tools, approaches and setups that will benefit in future. CICD demo emcompasses:

- Github actions:

  - actions/checkout
  - actions/cache
  - actions/setup-java
  - actions/upload-artifact

- Multiple self-hosted runners
  - Windows 10
  - Linux/GNOME (OpenSuse 15.5)
  - Linux CLI-only (OpenSuse 15.5)

- Junit 5 test cases
  
- Playwright test cases
  - Chrome
  - FF
  - Webkit (Safari)

- Test tools
  - Rest-Assured / RestSharp
  - Wiremock
  - Allure (TBD) & customer test reporting classes
  - Browserstack integration
 
- Docker image creation
 - JAR deployment and execution
