I've seen test automation-first approaches and CICD pipelines on a few of my last projects. I wanted to have deeper understanding of the complexities setting this up from scratch and so here I am. Currently, I'm workng on a couple of demo projects that feature:

- Github actions:

  - actions/checkout
  - actions/cache
  - actions/setup-java
  - actions/upload-artifact

- Multiple self-hosted runners
  - Windows 10
  - Linux/GNOME (OpenSuse 15.5)
  - Linux CLI-only (OpenSuse 15.5)

- Junit 5 test cases
  
- Playwright test cases
  - Chrome
  - FF
  - Webkit (Safari)

- Test tools
 - Rest-Assured / RestSharp
 - Wiremock

- Browserstack integration
  - Chrome 
 
- Docker image creation
 - JAR deployment and execution
